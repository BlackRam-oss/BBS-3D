## Instructions (for those unfamiliar with Git)

First of all to download the files just click on Code (watch example). You'll have 2 options download a zipper or use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) (if you want to keep the folder updated: [link](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/keeping-your-local-repository-in-sync-with-github/syncing-your-branch)).

If you downloaded the zipper, just extract the files in a folder, otherwise:

(Important) After that you have to add the created folder as Daz library, like this.

## Fix Clothes

I noticed that loading a set of my clothes (g3) may give problems , as in this case:

![alt text](https://github.com/DonRP/BBS-3D/blob/master/images/2021-06-08-111435.webp "Daz")

To fix this you will have to add the dress (g3):

The dress will have the default textures. To get the textures modified by me. Just follow these steps:

Click on the dress in my set (the one with problems). Copy the textures:

Click on the new dress (the one you just added). And paste the textures:

After that delete the dress with problems. And as you can see in the example, the dress will not have the previous problems:
