## Instructions (for those unfamiliar with Git)

First of all to download the files just click on Code (watch example). You'll have 2 options download a zipper or use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) (if you want to keep the folder updated: [link](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/keeping-your-local-repository-in-sync-with-github/syncing-your-branch)).

If you downloaded the zipper, just extract the files in a folder, otherwise:

(Important) After that you have to add the created folder as Daz library, like this.
